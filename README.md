    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Rahul and I am a passionate web developer with a focus on front-end designing. I have a background in SSC (Secondary School Certificate) and a diploma in CEHV10 (Certified Ethical Hacker Version 10). I am enthusiastic about creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that great web design goes beyond just aesthetics. It should also provide an intuitive and seamless user experience. I enjoy working with modern technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring ideas to life and create engaging web interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I am located in Hello Home, where I continue to expand my knowledge and skills in web development. I love to collaborate with fellow developers and contribute to exciting projects that push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to explore my portfolio and projects to get a better sense of my work. If you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential collaboration, please don't hesitate to contact me.
